# Analysis of Likelihood of Bar Exam Passage Using Predictive Analytics in R 

Each law school student who is accepted into a program must first take the LSAT and submit their LSAT score and Undergraduate GPA (UGPA) as part of their application package to law school. By using the LSAT score and UGPA, we attempted to predict whether a student would or would not pass the bar exam. If successful, this could assist law school admissions offices when selecting whether to admit a student into the program or not. Additionally, we explored the dataset provided by LSAC for other important factors contributing to or hindering passing the bar exam, e.g. does race, gender, or background have a correlation with a range of LSAT scores and how high is their bar passing rate.When reviewing admissions files, a model that could predict the probability of success of a potential law school student could be useful in situations where admissions are limited and the admissions office is looking for candidates that have the highest chance of succeeding and passing the bar exam. 

We primarily utilized predictive modeling in R for this project
